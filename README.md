# repetition-bot

This bot tweets out the same Kierkegaard quotation every day. At least, if you set up a cronjob to make it run every day.

Since Twitter does not like the posting of duplicate statuses, it inserts permutations of blank unicode symbols into the main tweet.

The true significance of this bot lies in the generation and insertion of these invisible strings.
